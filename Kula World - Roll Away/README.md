## Behavior
* The timer will automatically start upon confirming the game mode in the main menu
* Both "Arcade" mode and "The Final" are supported
* You can choose whether to split upon completion of each World or upon completion of every single stage (this option requires you to provide a whooping 150 splita)
* Automatic in-game timer calculation is provided by the script
* No milliseconds will be shown by the in-game timer. This is a deliberate choice made to accomodate the game's behaviour and its internal timer.
