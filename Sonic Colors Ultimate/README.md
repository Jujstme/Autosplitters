# Sonic Colors: Ultimate

## Autosplitter
LiveSplit autosplitter designed to handle automatic split and in-game timer calculation for Sonic Colors: Ultimate.

## Supported versions
The script is to be used with the PC version of the game only.

## Autosplitting behavior
* For Any% runs, the timer will automatically start upon confirming navigator settings upon starting a new game, in accordance to speedrun.com rules for Any% category
* For Egg Shuttle runs, the timer will automatically start upon loading the first level in Egg Shuttle mode (Tropical Resort Act 1)

* The script automatically detects whether you are running in Egg Shuttle or not. This will allow for custom coding according to the run category in the future
* If the timer is already running, selecting "New Game" in the main menu will cause it to automatically reset. Useful for Any% runs

* Autosplitting is performed upon completion of each level (this option can be configured in the settings, if you wish to reduce the number of total splits in your LiveSplit layout)
* Automatic in-game timer calculation is provided by the script
