# Kula World / Roll Away

## Autosplitter
LiveSplit autosplitter designed to handle automatic split and in-game timer calculation for the PS1 game Kula World / Roll Away.

## Supported versions
The script currently supports the NTSC-US version of the game only. Support for the PAL version is planned and will be added soon.

## Supported emulators
* Retroarch (using Beetle PSX core)
* Retroarch (using Beetle PSX HW core)
* Retroarch (using PCSX_Rearmed core)
* ePSXe v2.0.5
* ePSXe v2.0.2-1
* ePSXe v2.0.0
* ePSXe v1.9.25


## Behavior
* The timer will automatically start upon confirming the game mode in the main menu
* Both "Arcade" mode and "The Final" are supported
* You can choose whether to split upon completion of each World or upon completion of every single stage (this option requires you to provide a whooping 150 splita)
* Automatic in-game timer calculation is provided by the script
** No milliseconds will be shown by the in-game timer. This is a deliberate choice made to accomodate the game's behaviour and its internal timer.
